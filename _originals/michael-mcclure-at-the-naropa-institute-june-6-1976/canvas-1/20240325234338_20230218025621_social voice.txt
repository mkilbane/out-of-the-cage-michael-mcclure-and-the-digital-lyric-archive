3629	3629	(To listen for the social voice is to apprehend the lived histories telescoped in a performer’s embodied vocal expression. McClure’s speech is the liquid instrument of an avid performer, one that betrays no especially particular regional distinctiveness save perhaps slightly nasal, slight ironic casualness of his generational milieu. As McClure moves in and out of beast language, letting the phonemic order of English dissolve into long vowels wrapped in deliciously indulged alveolar approximates and glottal fricatives, he means for us to hear the body, as it were. More particularly, though, we hear the 43-year-old male-gendered body that spent its childhood between Kansas and the Pacific Northwest and its adulthood in countercultural California. These social indices mediate the ecological of beast language, this “mammalian communication based on a commonality of meat” (Kahn 339). Tracing beast language to its inspirations in the work of Antonin Artaud, the “biological language” of Wilhelm Reich, and Kundalini yoga, Douglas Kahn has detailed how McClure’s poems are “animated by an organismic poetics under the auspices of biology, genetics, ecology, and mammalianism, rooted in a bioself concomitant with other creatures and elaborated by an antipolitics of biological activism” (32).)
